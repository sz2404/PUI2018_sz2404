## Part 2 - Citibike Mini Project

I review the project suggestion provided by cb4221 and incorporated the following changes:

  1. Null Hypothesis revision
  2. Using Mann-Whitney U test
  3. Additional tests: Chi-Square and Fischer's Exact Test

I wrote up a short summary report of my Citibike Mini project which includes project background, data and methodology used, as well testing results. The report is finished through Authorea. 

Revised notebook with testing results have been uploaded into the HW7 folder, can be accessed here:
