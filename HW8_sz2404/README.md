## Part 1 - Plot

**Caption:**
This bar plot demonstrates the monthly average weight of trash and recycled material of collected from communities under each of the five boroughs of New York City. The measurement unit is in tons. The original data was collected on a monthly basis showing the weight of each community under the boroughs. The number of communities are very different among the 5 boroughs, and therefore, the mean was calculated to represent their tonnage record. 

The notebook for making the plot can be found [here](../HW8_sz2404/HW8_sz2404_Plot.ipynb)

## Part 2 - Citibike Mini Project

I review the project suggestion provided by cb4221 and incorporated the following changes:

  1. Null Hypothesis revision
  2. The typo of nunique() was corrected to count() instead of unique() as I was interested in finding out how many rides were  collected for each user type. The functon nunique() would be able to count all the unique start times under a usertype. However, some rides can start at the same and the result of nunique() would not be able to cover all the counts. 
  2. Using Mann-Whitney U test
  3. Additional tests: Chi-Square and Fischer's Exact Test

I wrote up a short summary report of my Citibike Mini project which includes project background, data and methodology used, as well testing results. The report is finished through Authorea. 

Revised notebook with testing results have been uploaded into the HW7 folder, can be accessed [here](../HW7_sz2404/HW4_Part2_sz2404_tested.ipynb).
