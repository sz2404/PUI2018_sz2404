# Plot Review

Clarity: Your caption and plot title are very clear, which help to me understand your content. This kind of horizontal bar graph shows the relationship between trash and recycle clearly. But I think that you might label the different color wrong, the grey one should be trash and the blue one should be recycle.

Esthetic: You chose color properly! (If the blue is for recycle and grey is for trash, because people usually regard bright color represents a positive information.) 

Honesty: Your plot honestly shows the raw data.
