# Homework 11
## Part 1 MTA Rides:
I had many discussions with three classmates (stated below). 

I am not very familiar with numpy arrays and found pandas dataframe is easier to understand. Therefore, for many parts, I converted the numpy array to dataframes for plotting and modelling. 

I will make a note to myself to improve my knowledge in numpy arrays.

## Part 2 Plot modifications:
I worked alone on this part. 

There has been some changes on the dataset I worked on (City Tonnage data). It includes more historical data. To keep it the same idea and scope as the original one, I dropped some other years data. However, there seems to be numerical differences which can be due to number changes. I generally incorporated some suggestions from peers to fix certain issues from the plot and make it less confusing. 

## Collaboration:
I had discussions with Alia Kasem, Chang (Angel) Liu, Antonio Kodsy on the tasks and we shared some technical links for Part 1 of the homework. Alia and Angel also explained to me their thought on the ts_mean/station_mean. 

## Extra Note:

I have applied and used the 72-hour extension this week. 

## Reference:
I referred to many links from Stack Overflow for technical issues as well as Chris Albon's blog on specific functions and results. 

Reference links are stated throughout the notebook.
