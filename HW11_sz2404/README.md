# Homework 11
## Part 1 MTA Rides:

## Part 2 Plot modifications:
I worked alone on this part. 

There has been some changes on the dataset I worked on (City Tonnage data). It includes more historical data. To keep it the same idea and scope as the original one, I dropped some other years data. However, there seems to be numerical differences which can be due to number changes. I generally incorporated some suggestions from peers to fix certain issues from the plot and make it less confusing. 

## Collaboration:
As usual, I have a feeling that I will discuss the homework with Alia and Angel.
