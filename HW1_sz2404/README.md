# Homework 1 - Forking, Merging, Conflict Resolution
I created the account gittest_sz2404 for testing forking, merging, and conflict resolution. 
I worked with myself's other account. 

# Homework 2 - PUI2018 Repository
I created a new repository following the instruction and using the methods from the lab.
  1. Create the PUI2018_sz2404 web repository. 
  2. Open my terminal. 
  3. Use the mkdir command to create the new folder on my local machine. 
  4. Use the cd command to get into the folder. 
  5. Use touch README.md to create a file inside PUI2018_sz2404
  6. Use git remote add origin https://github.com/sz2404/PUI2018_sz2404.git (it shows the remote origin already exist so I cAN push my files to be synced online). 

## Last Week's assignment demonstrate:

The following parts demonstrates creating environmental variables and alias.
I followed the instructions from the previous assignment, located here: 
https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/blob/master/HW1_fb55/HW1_2_instructions.md

I used the export function to create the environmental variables, and I used the alias function to create a alias which is a shortcut to access my folders for storing PUI2018 assignments.

Here is my bash_profile:

And here is testing results for my environmental variables and alias
