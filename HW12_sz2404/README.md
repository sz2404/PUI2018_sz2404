# Homework 12
## Part 1
I referred to many online resources to understand FFT theory and how it applies to the subway swipes. Also, Angel and Alia had discussions with me. Angel also offered me some guidance on constructing for loops. 

## Part 2
Due to time constraints, I only finished partially of Part 2 but I plan to learn and finish it later. 

## Collaboration:
I consulted Change (Angel) Liu and Alia Kasem. We had discussions on Fast Fourier Transform which helped me understand the Part 1 of the assignment better so I was able to plot and identify the results. 

## Reference:
Many reference links are cited as statements throughout the notebook.
