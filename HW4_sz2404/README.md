## Homework Part 1
I followed instructions from professor's skeleton notebook and produced my other distritbutions. 
## Homework Part 1 - Extra Credit
I referred to links from stackflow also read in the Statistics in a Nutshell book about Gaussian distribution. 
For the Gaussian line, I used the function norm.pdf to obtain value from the y-axis. X-axis is based on all the means. 

## Homework Part 2
I found the usertype column demosntrates subcribers (people with long-term membership) versus customers (people who purchased 24-hour/3-day passes). So I want to explore tourists usage of CitiBikes on weekends vs weekdays. I also included the distribution of locals using Citibikes as contrasts. 

## Homework Part 3
I follow professor's instructure on how to calculate Z-test score and refer to the lecture slides about what criteria is being used and how to interpret it for null hypothesis rejection. 

## Collaboration 
I had a quick discussion with Professor Bianco regarding my null hypothese for the Citibike part. I also had discussion with Alia Kasem on all the parts and we shared some reference links for technical issues. 

## Reference
I have included all the reference links as # statements in my ipynb cells.
