## Part 1 - Plot Review
I reviewed the plots produced by rs6431 and ks5063. 

The reviews are saved in HW9_sz2404 folder and for [rs6431](../HW9_sz2404/rs6431_plotReview_sz2404.md) and [ks5063](../HW9_sz2404/ks5063_plotReview_sz2404.md).

Pull requests have been sent to repo owners for merging. 
## Part 2 - Practice: Statsmodel OLS and WLS
I followed Dr. Bianco's skeleton notebook. 

## Part 3 - OLS & WLS Regression Model

I followed Dr. Bianco's skeleton notebook. 

I have included all the raw data file within this folder:

Population: click [here](../HW9_sz2404/API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_excel_v2_10181007.xls)

GDP: click [here](../HW9_sz2404/API_NY.GDP.MKTP.CD_DS2_en_excel_v2_10203546.xls)

Firearms murders and owndership: click [here](../HW9_sz2404/World firearms murders and ownership.xlsx)

Mass shooting: click [here](../HW9_sz2404/data-pvLFI.csv)

Note on GDP value: 
It can be seen that the GDP has slight differences between the data I collected and Dr. Bianco's number. The dataset I used was updated around 2018 October reflecting the current US dollar value. The notebook stated CUSP 2017 at the beginning at therefore, the data below (generated by Dr. Bianco) might have used the data from a previous year and therefore, reflecting a different currency value.

# Collaboration:
Part 1: I worked alone for this part. 

Part 2 & Part 3: I had general discussions with Alia Kasem to make sure that I have correctly understood the instructions. Also, we two exchanged some sources on some technical issues on plotting, statisics etc. 

# Reference:
References has made along the notebook whenever functions were borrowed from Stack Overflow other other Python Package Documentations.
