### CLARITY: 

**Comments:** 

The quadrant plot is straightforward for interpretation. The titles and the caption give good guidance. 
It can possibly be even better if a legend is added to demonstrate the difference between colours (i.e dark red means higher charges?).It might also be helpful to include in the caption that the charge is on the basis of the community or per capita average of this borough.
Overall, the information has been conveyed very clearly.



### AESTHETIC: 

**Comments:** 

Colour choice of the different boroughs' utility charge is good that the expenses rank of the boroughs can be seen easily. Meanwhile, the Color Oracle test shows that it works well for colour blindness viewers. The blue coloured borough names on top of dark red is a little bit unpleasant to look at. The plot has well-structured layout and with no redundant elements. 


### HONESTY: 

**Comments:** 

The plot seems to have presented the data honestly through good processing of the original data. Colour codes reflect the data in a consistent way among all the plots so no discrepancies affecting honesty.
