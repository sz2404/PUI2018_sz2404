### CLARITY: 
*is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?*

**Comments:** 

The quadrant plot is straightforward for interpretation. The titles and the caption give good guidance. 
It can possibly be even better if a legend is added to demonstrate the difference between colours (i.e dark red means higher charges?).It might also be helpful to include in the caption that the charge is on the basis of the community or per capita average of this borough.
Overall, the information has been conveyed very clearly.



### AESTHETIC: 
*beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?*

**Comments:** 

Colour choice of the different boroughs' utility charge is good that the expenses rank of the boroughs can be seen easily. Meanwhile, the Color Oracle test shows that it works well for colour blindness viewers. The blue coloured borough names on top of dark red is a little bit unpleasant to look at. The plot has well-structured layout and with no redundant elements. 


### HONESTY: 
*is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?*

**Comments:** 

The plot seems to have presented the data honestly through good processing of the original data. Colour codes reflect the data in a consistent way among all the plots so no discrepancies affecting honesty.
