## Review for ks5063:

### CLARITY: 
*is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?*

**Comments:** 

The quadrant plot is straightforward for interpretation. The titles and the caption give good guidance of information that should be expected. It can possibly be even better if a legend is added to demonstrate the difference between colours (i.e dark red means higher charges or lower?).

Another item can possibly be considered is to have an explanation of the term 'charges' if possible (i.e if charge means the rate by unit of consumption or it includes transmission/distribution fees etc.). It might also be helpful to include in the caption that the charge is on the basis of the community or per capita or per business average of this borough. 

Overall, the information has been conveyed very clearly. 


### AESTHETIC: 
*beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?*

**Comments:** 

Colour choice of the different boroughs' utility charge is very good that audience can tell the potential expenses rank of the three boroughs easily. At the same time, the Color Oracle testing was used and it seems to work well for audiences with colour blindness issues. The colour of the borough names can possibly be considered to change. At this moment, the blue colour, on top of dark red can be just a little bit unpleasant to look at. 

Aesthetic-wise in general, the plot has well-structured layout and very concise without reduntant elements. Non of the grapical elements would cause any distractions. 

### HONESTY: 
*is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?*

**Comments:** 

After reviewing the notebook, the plot seems to have presented the data honestly through good processing of the original data. Map projection choice is nice that the final visualization of the borough shapes/relative locations are close to how audiences normally picture the boroughs (so less distorted based on public perception). Colour codes reflects the data in a consistant way among all the plots so no discrepancies affecting honesty.
