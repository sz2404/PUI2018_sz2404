## Review for rs6431:

### CLARITY: 
**is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous? **

The plot is straightforward and I personally find it simple to interpret. The title, legend, as well as the caption as easy to follow for any audiences. 

Potentially, it can be considered to zoom into just the smaller area where all the food services are so that clustering and overlay of dots can be avoided. Additionally, streets can be added to the map to demonstrate the location of food services a littler better. In this way, it will be even more helpful to the tourists and as well as researchers who are interested in the pattern of Time Square food services. 

### ESTHETIC: 
**beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?**

Colour choice of this plot is very good that different types of food services can be easily distinguished from others. The colours are pleasant and does not cause visually uncomfortableness. At the same time, the Color Oracle testing was used and it seems to work well for audiences with colour blindness issues. 

The map plotting projection can possibly be changed a little bit to make the distribution shape less distorted. In addition, possibly zooming more into the area can reduce the appearance of blank spaces. 

### HONESTY: 
**is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?**

After reviewing the notebook, the plot seems to have presented the data honestly with persepctive to using and processing of the original data. The map projection caused a little bit of distortion on the shape of the district map. Comparing to the original shape of the Time Square district from the notebook, the shape of the final plot demonstrates certain degrees of stretch on the east-west axis and compress on the north-south axis. Therefore, the accuracy of the location with regards to it's distance to the district border might have been compromised.
