### CLARITY: 

The plot is straightforward for common public interpretation. The title, legend, and the caption are easy to follow. 

Potentially, it can be considered to zoom into where all the food services are so overlay of dots can be avoided. Streets can be possibly added to the map to demonstrate the location of food services. Additionally, comparing to the original district shape from the notebook, the shape of the final plot demonstrates certain degrees of stretch on the east-west axis. Therefore, the accuracy of the locations and distnaces might have been compromised for a little bit.

### AESTHETIC: 

Colour choice of this plot is very good that different types of food services can be distinguished from others. The colours are pleasant and do not cause any visual discomfort. At the same time, the Color Oracle testing was used and it seems to work well for audiences with colour blindness issues. Additionally, zooming into the food services area can reduce the blank space.

### HONESTY: 

After reviewing the notebook, the plot seems to have presented the data honestly with perspective to using and processing of the original data. No information deformation was identified.
