# Homework 10
## Part 1 - LR Test Lab
I followed the instructions from Dr.Bianco's notebook.

## Part 2 - Energy Consumption & PLUTO
I followed the instructions from Dr.Bianco's notebook. 

### Extra Credit for Part 2:
I only completed the EC2, plotting everything. In addition, I made an extra plot to investigate the 'energy efficiency' of building. 

## Collaboration:

I mostly finished this homework by myself. I had general discussions and shared technical links with Alia Kasem and Chang (Angel) Liu. 

I consulted Chun-Chieh Tsai (a former CUSP folk) for Chi-square definition. 

## Reference: 
Reference of technical information from Stack Overflow, Python documentation, as well as statistical references have been documented throughout the notebook as # statements.
