# Homework 7

## GeoPandas practices. 


# Collaboration:
I did this assignment mostly on my own till this moment but I'm probably going to ask other questions so who knows. 

# Reference:
1. Citibike notebook instructions delivered by Chris Prince in class. I referred to some of his commands.
2. Some technical issues I referred to links from Stackflow. I have referenced those links throughout my notebook. 
3. I just found out the way to rename a Github folder: https://blog.github.com/2013-03-15-moving-and-renaming-files-on-github/
